# Interfacing the Simulation to ROS

The simulated autopilot starts a second MAVLink interface on port 14557. Connecting MAVROS to this port allows to receive all data the vehicle would expose if in real flight.

## Launching MAVROS

If an interface to ROS is wanted, the already running secondary MAVLink instance can be connected to ROS via [mavros](ros-mavros-offboard.md). To connect to a specific IP (`fcu_url` is the IP / port of SITL), use a URL in this form:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14540@192.168.1.36:14557"
```

To connect to localhost, use this URL:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14540@127.0.0.1:14557"
```

## Launching Gazebo with ROS wrappers

In case you would like to modify the Gazebo simulation to integrate sensors publishing directly to ROS topics e.g. the Gazebo ROS laser plugin, Gazebo must be launched with the appropriate ROS wrappers. To do this start the simulator with `no_sim=1`:

```sh
nosim_=1 make posix_sitl_default gazebo
```

This should start the simulator and the console will look like this

```sh
[init] shell id: 46979166467136
[init] task name: mainapp

______  __   __    ___
| ___ \ \ \ / /   /   |
| |_/ /  \ V /   / /| |
|  __/   /   \  / /_| |
| |     / /^\ \ \___  |
\_|     \/   \/     |_/

Ready to fly.

```

Now in a new terminal make sure you will be able to insert the Iris model through the Gazebo menus, to do this set your environment variables to include the appropriate `sitl_gazebo` folders.

```sh
# Set the plugin path so Gazebo finds our model and sim
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:[PATH_TO_FIRMWARE]/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/Build
# Set the model path so Gazebo finds the airframes
# Disable online model lookup since this is quite experimental and unstable
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}:[PATH_TO_FIRMWARE]/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models
```

Now start Gazebo like you would when working with ROS and insert the Iris quadcopter model. Once the Iris is loaded it will automatically connect to the px4 app.
```sh
roslauch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch
```
